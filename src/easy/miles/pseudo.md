# Pseudo Code Solution

1 - have conversion ratio 1.6km = 1 mile
    --> function takes in km as parameter
    --> do some maths

2 - store the miles as we convert
    --> variable 

3 - rounds up or down to nearest mile
    --> math.floor() - rounds down 
    --> math.ceil() - round up
        --> when does it round up? .5 ^
        --> when does it round down (everything else)
            --> if else

4 - output of miles
    --> return no of miles (rounded)
