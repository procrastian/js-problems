# Plain English Solution
Convert kilometers to miles - assume 1.6 kilometers in a mile and round your answer to the nearest mile (e.g. `1.6` should be `2`, as should `2.4`. `2.5` should be `3`).

1 - have conversion ratio 1.6km = 1 mile
2 - store the miles as we convert
3 - rounds up or down to nearest mile
4 - output of miles
